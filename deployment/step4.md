# Setup Cloud Side (KubeEdge Master Node)
<br>
keadm init will install cloudcore, generate the certs and install the CRDs.

`keadm init --advertise-address=172.30.1.2`{{execute HOST1}}

--advertise-address (non-mandatory flag) is the address exposed by the cloud side (will be added to the SANs of the CloudCore certificate), the default value is the local IP.

**Now you can see KubeEdge cloudcore is running.**
